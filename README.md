# dog-classifier
Dog Classifier project under github repo

As part of Udaity Nano Degree program the dog breed classifier project is done.
This contails different approches of classifing a dog breed.
This project also has models that differenciate between Human and dog using VGG16 model directly

A simple CNN layer is created to classify dog breed attaining 11% accuracy.(This is done as part of learning how to create CNN networks)

A model that uses transfer learning to do dog breed classification and attains 87% accuracy is also part of this project. VGG16 is used for transfer learning.
